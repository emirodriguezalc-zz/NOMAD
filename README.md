I started on may 29th, designing and getting familiar with the product.
On may 30th, i started coding the skeleton of the page; sidebar and header.
My wife re-painted the logos by hand in a bigger canvas in order to get a higher quality image. She did the same with the image on the 404 page!
Then i moved on to the cpu page. It was the one i struggled the most with, because i have no experience with charts.
If i were to do it again, i would spend even more time reading docs, and maybe choose another library.
The summary page was fun because of the search of free API's and the construction and styling and the trials and errors with the components i made from scratch using hooks, and learning from it
Then decided to move on to the thumb page. I enjoyed it the most because of the satisfaction of creating something
purely visual, and because i found the error that was messing my summary code while coding the thumb component, and fixed it.

I had a really great time coding my baby nomad, could not wait to get off work and put my hands into this code.
I have been programming in react for the past 1.5 years (Of a total of 2.5 years of coding). That is not a lot, and therefore, i am proud of what i did. I learned a lot with nomad and i am eager to keep on learning. I hope you enjoy it as much as i do.

About the things that were not that great, i would say that the chart page, the side menu, and the testing are the nominated ones. I do not have much to say about the testing, because there isn't any. I spent 3/4 hours a day coding and could not make it.
The side bar is kinda premade. I hoped to recode it in the end, but did not manage to do it. I focused on delivering within the time given and refactoring later if i had time.
The cpu page took loads of time and gave little results. I am determined to learn more about charts because i know how important they are.

I appreciate the feedback in order to keep on growing as a professional!

Thank you for your time and this opportunity.
